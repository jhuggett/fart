# Paths and 3D

Read this for a `path`, a `"space": "3d"` model, sweeps, pipes, smooth surfaces, paint, shades, modifiers, skins, projection to 2D views, glTF export and import, the compiled sidecar, or 3D collision. The core skill (SKILL.md) covers the 2D file.

## Paths (1.7)

A `path` is a cubic polybézier: `points`, and per point `in` and `out`
tangent handles **relative to the point** (absent or `[0,0]`: a
corner). `closed: true` fills; open, it strokes with `w`. Editors (and
`fart bake`) write `bake: {points, tris}`, the polygon it flattens to
at 0.05 units, so a 1.6 reader draws it as a poly; a hand-written file
can skip the bake. A poly with no handles is still a `poly`. Morphs
replace `points` and the handles ride along (a morph may carry `in`/
`out` too). The circle constant: a quarter turn of radius r is one cubic
with handles of length 0.5523·r along the tangents.

```json
{"kind": "path", "color": "skin", "closed": true,
 "points": [[-6,-4],[6,-4],[8,0],[6,4],[-6,4],[-8,0]],
 "in":  [[-2,0],[-2,0],[0,-2],[2,0],[2,0],[0,2]],
 "out": [[2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[-2,0],[-2,0],[0,-2]]}
```

## 3D

A file with `"space": "3d"` is a low-poly model in the same words with a
third coordinate. Model props once, then project them to the 2D views a
2D game draws, or load them straight into a 3D game.

- **Frame**: x right, y **down**, z **away** (right-handed). The front
  of a thing faces -z (a muzzle points at the viewer in the front view);
  dropping z is the front view. Most engines are y-up: `Y_UP` / `to_y_up`
  in the loaders turn the frame (x, -y, -z) at draw time; never model
  y-up.
- **Shapes**: `mesh` (`points` `[x,y,z]`, `faces` as index loops wound
  so `(p1-p0)×(p2-p0)` points **out of the solid**, `tris` baked by
  `bakeTris3` or the studio), `ball` (`at`, `r`), `rod` (`a`, `b`, `w`).
  One token per shape, `shade` as in 2D. A face wound the wrong way
  vanishes in every view.
- **Parts and poses** as in 2D: `pivot` `[x,y,z]` at the joint, `parent`,
  `like`; a pose's `rotate` is `[x,y,z]` radians about x, then y, then
  z (a turn about z is the 2D rotate); `scale` uniform; `mirror` flips
  x. Between keys turns slerp. Anchors take `dir` (a direction) instead
  of `angle`. Chains work with a `pole` (a document-space point the
  elbow leans toward) instead of `bend`; targets are `[x,y,z]`.
- **Build by script, with the helpers**, never by typing coordinates:

  ```js
  import { box, extrude, lathe, bakeTris3, projectDoc, stringifyDoc, validate } from "@fastart/core";
  box("wood", [cx, cy, cz], [sx, sy, sz])                       // a box
  extrude("steel", [[z0, y0], [z1, y1], ...], "x", -1, 1)       // a side profile (any winding, concave is fine) as a prism
  lathe("brass", [[r0, t0], [r1, t1], ...], "y", 12)            // a profile of [radius, along] revolved: barrels, bottles, wheels
  { kind: "rod", color, a, b, w }  { kind: "ball", color, at, r }  // ribs, chains, eyes, knobs
  ```
  For `extrude` the profile is `[z, y]` on axis x, `[x, z]` on y, `[x, y]`
  on z. Every helper returns faces wound outward; `windOutward(mesh)`
  fixes a hand-made one. `examples/pistol/generate.mjs` (a flintlock from
  extruded profiles) and `examples/lantern/generate.mjs` (lathes, a box,
  rods) are the models to copy.
- **Conventions**: the same scale as the 2D art (a pistol ~24 units
  long); one part per thing that moves, its pivot at the hinge; parts
  that pass through each other project badly (the painter's order is
  per part), so split them; keep a ball's centre on or in front of the
  surface it sits on; tokens for colour, `shade` for baked light,
  `emissive` for glow.
- **Project** to 2D: `npx fart project model.fart --view left --view top
  [--outline ink:0.25]`. A turn about the view axis stays a real 2D pose
  (parents kept, clips tweened); anything else bakes into variant parts
  (`hammer@1`) and the clip subdivides at 12 fps. `left` is the
  side-scroller profile (muzzle right), `top` the top-down sprite (muzzle
  up). `spec/PROJECT.md` has the rules.
- **Export** for other engines: `npx fart gltf model.fart` writes a
  `.glb` (a node per part, vertex colours, an animation per clip, y-up).
- **Import** a model made elsewhere (Blender's own glTF export, no
  plugin): `npx fart import model.glb [-o model.fart] [--scale n]
  [--height n] [--merge] [--split-materials] [--no-quads]
  [--no-shades]`, or `importGltf(bytes, options)` from `@fastart/core`
  (`gltfBufferUris` lists the `.bin` files a `.gltf` wants in
  `options.buffers`). A part per mesh node (snake_case names, the
  node's origin as `pivot`, the nearest mesh node above as `parent`),
  points in document space at rest, a token per material, one shape per
  mesh with `colors` + `paint` (1.8) unless `--split-materials`,
  triangles paired into quads, split vertices welded, `normals:
  "smooth"` where the source shades smooth, vertex colours as `shades`,
  animations as clips, morph targets as states. It prints what it left
  out (textures, cameras, lights; a skin becomes rigid parts) and
  refuses compressed geometry. A Blender model is in metres: pass
  `--height` or `--scale` so three decimals keep its detail. In Uranus:
  File › Import glTF… (⌘I), or the `import_gltf` tool.
- **Collision in 3D (1.4)**: `collision` holds `ball`, `rod`, convex
  `mesh`, and `box` (`at` centre, `size` full extents, optional `rotate`;
  never in `shapes`). A collision `mesh` must be **convex** (error
  `convex`, naming the face): author concave solids as several pieces.
  `part` makes a solid ride a part; `layer` tags it. `npx fart hull
  model.fart [--part name]` writes a convex hull of each part's visible
  shapes into `collision` (`meta.hull` marks them, rerun replaces), so
  most props need no hand-written collision. The model screen's
  Collision button shows the solids posed, and a part's **hull** button
  does the same as the CLI.
- **Morphs (1.6)**: a state can reshape a mesh as well as place it. A
  state entry's `morph` lists `{"shape": i, "points": [...]}` per mesh
  of the part: the same number of points as the base, in the same
  order; faces and `tris` stay. Clips lerp the corners between keys
  (eased), so a breathing chest, a blinking eye or a bending tentacle
  segment is two states and a clip. A part drawn `like` another cannot
  morph (error `morph`), nor can balls, rods or collision. In 2D the
  same field reshapes a `poly`. Projection bakes a morphed entry into a
  variant part; glTF export writes morph targets with animated weights.
  Build one by script (`points` is `mesh.points.map(...)`), or in Uranus
  with the model screen's **Deform** toggle (D): corner drags then land
  in the current state's morph instead of the base mesh.
- **Smooth surfaces (1.7)**: a mesh stays its low-poly cage; `normals:
  "smooth"` lights it by averaged vertex normals (no new geometry;
  `angle` in degrees keeps edges sharper than that flat), and `smooth: n`
  draws it Catmull-Clark subdivided n times (1 or 2; the cage is the
  file, readers subdivide). `creases` is `[[a, b, c], ...]` for edges
  (c in 0–1, 1 sharp; a fraction is a fillet) and `[a, c]` for corners,
  OpenSubdiv's rules. Morphs move the cage and the surface follows;
  collision and `fart hull` use the cage. `fart bake --smooth` writes
  the subdivided surface into `bake` for a game that will not subdivide
  (the Odin loader subdivides itself). Keep `smooth` at 1–2.
- **Sweeps (1.7)**: `{"kind": "sweep", "op": "lathe"|"extrude", "axis",
  "profile": {points, in, out}, "segments" | "from"/"to"}` keeps the
  profile (a path body: `[radius, along]` pairs for a lathe, a closed
  outline for an extrude) and generates the mesh; `smooth`, `normals`,
  `texture` apply to it. Prefer a sweep to a baked lathe when the shape
  may change later. A sweep does not morph and never goes in collision.
- **1.8 additions** (all optional; `{{FASTART}}/examples/helm/generate.mjs`
  uses every one):
  - **Paint**: `"colors": ["brass", "lining"]` and `"paint": [1, 0, 2,
    ...]` on a mesh or a sweep, one whole number per face: 0 is `color`,
    n is `colors[n-1]`. Count and range are checked (error `paint`).
    One shape, several tokens; no more splitting a mesh to colour a band.
  - **Shades**: `"shades": [1, 0.8, ...]` on a mesh, one number per
    point, multiplying `shade` there and interpolated across faces: soft
    shadow in a fold (error `shades` on a wrong count).
  - **Mods**: `"mods": [...]` on a mesh or a sweep, applied in order to
    the cage after a morph and before `smooth`. `{"op": "mirror",
    "axis": "x", "merge": 0.001}` (model half, keep the seam's points
    on 0 so they weld); `{"op": "solidify", "thick": 0.3, "offset": -1,
    "inner": 2, "rim": 1}` (a wall inward from the cage, an open edge
    gets a rim; `inner`/`rim` are paint indices); `{"op": "crease",
    "angle": 40, "value": 0.2}` (every edge sharper than the angle
    creased: with `smooth` that is a bevel). Model the cage as the
    outside, wound outward, and let the mods do the rest; `creases`,
    `paint` and `shades` you write are over the cage. An unknown op is
    error `mod`. `builtOf(shape)` is the cage with its mods applied.
  - **Pipe**: `{"kind": "sweep", "op": "pipe", "path": {"points":
    [[x,y,z], ...], "in", "out"}, "radius": 0.2, "radii": [1, 0.9, 0],
    "segments": 8, "caps": true, "closed": false}`: a round section (or
    a closed 2D `profile`) carried along a 3D path without twisting,
    scaled per path point by `radii` (0 at an end is a point). Plumes,
    horns, straps, wires. In a script, `pipe(color, path, opts)` returns
    the mesh. Paint a pipe by face only when its path has no handles
    (the face count follows the flattening).
  - `fart bake --smooth` writes the finished mesh of every smooth,
    modified or swept shape into `bake` (with `paint` and `shades` for
    it) for a reader that will not generate.
  - **The sidecar**: `npx fart build art/` writes `name.fart.glb`
    beside every 3D `name.fart`: a binary glTF with everything
    generated, far quicker to load than the JSON. It is a build
    artifact, never edited and never the source; a loader uses it only
    while its hash matches the `.fart`. Gitignore `*.fart.glb`, run
    `fart build` as a build step (`fart build --check art/` in CI,
    `--clean` to remove them).
- **Look at it**: open the folder in Uranus; a 3D file opens the model
  screen (orbit, the four tools make box/ball/rod/prism, Deform, the
  inspector's normals/smooth/crease fields, Project…).

### Loading in a 3D game (Odin, raylib)

`loaders/odin/examples/raylib_spin/main.odin` is the whole loop; the
shape of it:

```odin
doc, ok := fastart.load_bytes_3d(data)              // load_bytes refuses 3D files; this reads them
fastart.resolve_palettes_3d(&doc, resolver, nil)
for &p in doc.parts {                                // once: flatten each part to triangles
    tms := make([dynamic]fastart.Tri_Mesh)
    fastart.flatten_part(&doc, &p, &tms)             // per shape: positions, normals (rest space), color token, shade
    // upload: fastart.to_y_up(pos), to_y_up(normal); colour = shade_color(color_of_3d(&doc, tm.color), tm.shade)
}
fastart.sample_clip_3d(&doc, clip, t, &frame)       // every frame: the pose
fastart.sample_targets_3d(&doc, clip, t, &targets); fastart.solve_targets_3d(&doc, &frame, targets[:])   // live IK, if any
fastart.collision_world_3d(&doc, frame[:], &colliders)   // the solids under this pose: ball / rod / mesh (boxes arrive as meshes), each with .layer and .part
for sp in frame {
    W := fastart.Y_UP * fastart.world_xf_3d(&doc, frame[:], sp.part)   // rest → engine space
    rl.DrawMesh(mesh, material, rl.Matrix(W))
}
```

Light in a shader from the normals, or bake it into vertex colours the
way the example does. `blend_poses_3d`, `layer_poses_3d`,
`clip_events_3d`, `attach_xf_3d` (dir-aligned sockets) and
`apply_palette_3d` are the 2D calls with a third axis.

**TypeScript**: `as3d`, `worldTransforms3`, `sampleClip3`, `sampleTargets3`,
`solveTargets3`, `flattenPart`/`triMesh`, `Y_UP`, `projectDoc`, `toGlb`.

A frame's entries may morph (1.6): `morphs_3d(&doc, &sp)` says so, and
`flatten_part_posed(&doc, part, &sp, &tms)` flattens the part with the
frame's points; re-upload those meshes (raylib: `UpdateMeshBuffer` for
vertices and normals) and draw as before. Sample frames with the temp
allocator as `context.allocator`, since mixed morphs allocate their
points there, and `free_all` it each frame.
