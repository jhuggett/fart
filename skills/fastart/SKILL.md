description: Write, edit, validate and load .fart files (the Fast Art Format, JSON vector art for games, 2D and low-poly 3D, with parts, states, clips, IK chains, swappable palettes, collision, and textures that are themselves drawings) and .shart scenes (the Scene Hierarchy of Art, which places .fart files). Use when a game needs sprites, props, models, animations, palettes, textures or scenes made by hand or by script, when such files need checking or projecting from 3D to 2D, or when loading them in Odin or TypeScript.

# fastart: the Fast Art Format

A `.fart` file is JSON: shapes grouped into **parts**, arranged by
**states**, animated by **clips** (states in time), reached by IK
**chains**, coloured by named **slots** a palette fills in, surfaced by
**textures** that are themselves drawings, and, since 1.3, either flat
or a low-poly **3D** model (`"space": "3d"`) that projects to 2D views.
A `.shart` file is a **scene**: `.fart` files placed, posed and
recoloured in a tree. The format is the contract; the checkout at
`{{FASTART}}` holds the spec (`spec/FORMAT.md`, `spec/PROJECT.md`,
`spec/SHART.md`), the validator, the loaders, the studio and sample sets
(`examples/space`, `examples/pistol`, `examples/lantern`,
`examples/cabin`, with scenes in `examples/space/scenes` and
`examples/cabin/camp.shart`).

- The truth: `{{FASTART}}/spec/FORMAT.md` (read it when in doubt) and
  `{{FASTART}}/spec/fart.schema.json`.
- A complete sample project: `{{FASTART}}/examples/space` (ships, a
  station, rocks, projectiles, an explosion, palettes to swap) with the
  script that wrote it, `generate.mjs`. Copy its shape for new sets.

## Coordinates and conventions

- x right, y **down** (screen-like). Units are the file's own; the
  studio shows one unit as 10 px at its default zoom. A small ship is
  ~24 units long, a capital ship ~64, a pickup ~6.
- Top-down things point up: the nose is at negative y. A game adds its
  own heading when it draws.
- Names are lowercase snake_case. Mirrored parts end `_l` / `_r`.
- Anchors are where a game hooks in: `nose`, `gun_l`, `muzzle`, `tip`,
  `exhaust`, `hand`, `foot`, `dock_n`. Name them for the game, not the art.
- Colours are never literal. A shape names a **slot** (`hull`, `skin`,
  `trim`); the palette says what it means today.

## The file, annotated

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "name": "fighter",
  "palette_refs": ["../palettes/hull.fart"],
  "palette": [ {"name": "clasp", "rgb": [220, 190, 90, 255]} ],
  "parts": [
    {"name": "hull", "pivot": [0, 0],
     "shapes": [
       {"kind": "poly",   "color": "hull",  "points": [[0,-12],[3,-4],[3,6],[0,8],[-3,6],[-3,-4]]},
       {"kind": "line",   "color": "trim",  "a": [0,-6], "b": [0,4], "w": 0.8},
       {"kind": "circle", "color": "glass", "at": [0,-4], "r": 1.5}
     ],
     "anchors": [ {"name": "nose", "at": [0, -12]} ]},
    {"name": "wing_l", "parent": "hull", "pivot": [-3, 1], "shapes": [ ... ]}

  ],
  "clips": [
    {"name": "bank_left", "loop": false, "keys": [
      {"t": 0,    "state": "idle"},
      {"t": 0.25, "state": "bank_l", "ease": "out"}
    ]}
  ],
  "constraints": [ {"name": "arm", "chain": ["upper", "fore"], "end": "fore/hand", "bend": 1} ],

}
```

- **Shapes**: `circle` (`at`, `r`), `line` (`a`, `b`, `w`, round caps),
  `poly` (`points`, three or more, concave is fine). Order within a part
  is paint order. `tris` (index triples into `points`) is optional in a
  hand-written file: `fart bake` or the studio writes it; loaders fan
  without it.
- **Parts**: `pivot` is the point the part turns about and is placed by,
  in document space. A `parent` makes the part ride another (an arm on a
  torso, a turret on a hull): it is posed in the parent's frame, and
  paint order stays the state's list. Parents must exist and not loop.
- **States**: a named list of `{part, offset?, rotate?, scale?}`. The
  list is membership and paint order. `offset` is **where the pivot
  lands** (a position, not a delta; absent means the pivot itself, i.e.
  drawn as authored). `rotate` is radians; `scale` multiplies about the
  pivot. A file's first state is the one editors show. A file with no
  states draws all parts in file order.
- **Clips**: keys at `t` seconds, each naming a `state` (or carrying an
  inline `parts` list). Between keys, `offset` and `scale` tween
  linearly, `rotate` the short way round, bent by the *incoming* key's
  `ease`: `linear` (default), `in`, `out`, `in-out`, `step`. Which parts
  draw switches at keys, it never tweens. `loop` wraps at the last key's
  `t`; a loop that should ease back ends with a key equal to its first.
  A full turn needs three or more keys (thirds), since rotation tweens
  the short way.
- **Constraints**: `chain` lists parts root-first, each after the first
  parented to the previous; `end` is `part/anchor` on the last part;
  `bend` is `1` or `-1`. Games may solve live (`solveChain` /
  a CCD solver); the studio uses chains to pose, and saves ordinary states.
- **Collision**: shapes in document space, never drawn, `color`
  optional. Since 1.4 a collision shape may name a `part`: it is then in
  that part's rest space and rides the part's pose (a door flap's solid
  moves with the flap); `layer` (default `solid`) is an engine's tag
  (`surface`, `player`, `trigger`, whatever the game says). Loaders give
  the whole list in document space for a pose: `collisionWorld(doc,
  poses)` / `collision_world(&doc, poses, &out)`.
- **1.2 additions** (all optional; older readers ignore them):
  - `"like": "claw_r"` on a part: it draws that part's shapes and
    anchors and has none of its own (keep its own `pivot`, `parent`).
  - `"mirror": true` on a state entry: flipped about the pivot before
    the turn. A child rides its parent's mirror; do not mirror twice.
    The left claw is `{"name":"claw_l","like":"claw_r","pivot":[5,0]}`
    posed `{"part":"claw_l","mirror":true,"offset":[-5,0]}`.
  - `"angle"` on an anchor (radians): the direction an attached thing
    points. A game attaches by aligning anchors: `attach_xf(host_xf,
    &hand, &grip)`. Files never name what they hold.
  - `"targets": [{"chain":"arm","at":[x,y]}]` on a state or key: the
    chain reaches that document-space point. Bake the solved rotations
    into the pose too (the studio does), so non-solving readers draw it.
  - `"events": ["footstep"]` on a key: names a game hears crossing it.
  - `"curve": [x1,y1,x2,y2]` on a key: a cubic bezier, wins over
    `ease`; set `ease` to the nearest name as well.
  - `"emissive": 1.5` on a palette token: light the slot gives off.
- **1.3 additions**:
  - `"shade": 0.7` on a shape: multiplies the slot's r, g, b (alpha
    kept); lighting that survives a palette swap. Absent = 1.
  - `"space": "3d"` at the top: a 3D model. See **3D** below.
- **Palettes**: `palette` is the file's slots with default colours.
  `palette_refs` are paths relative to *this file* to palette files
  (colours and no parts). Lookup is the file's own palette first, then
  refs last to first. An unresolved slot paints loud magenta. Keep art
  files free of colours of their own when a project shares a palette;
  override a slot locally only when one file must differ.
- Unknown fields are kept by every tool, so `meta` and your own keys are safe.

## 3D

A file with `"space": "3d"` is a low-poly model in the same words with a
third coordinate. Model props once, then project them to the 2D views a
2D game draws, or load them straight into a 3D game.

- **Frame**: x right, y **down**, z **away** (right-handed). The front
  of a thing faces -z (a muzzle points at the viewer in the front view);
  dropping z is the front view. Most engines are y-up: `Y_UP` / `to_y_up`
  in the loaders turn the frame (x, -y, -z) at draw time; never model
  y-up.
- **Shapes**: `mesh` (`points` `[x,y,z]`, `faces` as index loops wound
  so `(p1-p0)×(p2-p0)` points **out of the solid**, `tris` baked by
  `bakeTris3` or the studio), `ball` (`at`, `r`), `rod` (`a`, `b`, `w`).
  One token per shape, `shade` as in 2D. A face wound the wrong way
  vanishes in every view.
- **Parts and poses** as in 2D: `pivot` `[x,y,z]` at the joint, `parent`,
  `like`; a pose's `rotate` is `[x,y,z]` radians about x, then y, then
  z (a turn about z is the 2D rotate); `scale` uniform; `mirror` flips
  x. Between keys turns slerp. Anchors take `dir` (a direction) instead
  of `angle`. Chains work with a `pole` (a document-space point the
  elbow leans toward) instead of `bend`; targets are `[x,y,z]`.
- **Build by script, with the helpers**, never by typing coordinates:

  ```js
  import { box, extrude, lathe, bakeTris3, projectDoc, stringifyDoc, validate } from "@fastart/core";
  box("wood", [cx, cy, cz], [sx, sy, sz])                       // a box
  extrude("steel", [[z0, y0], [z1, y1], ...], "x", -1, 1)       // a side profile (any winding, concave is fine) as a prism
  lathe("brass", [[r0, t0], [r1, t1], ...], "y", 12)            // a profile of [radius, along] revolved: barrels, bottles, wheels
  { kind: "rod", color, a, b, w }  { kind: "ball", color, at, r }  // ribs, chains, eyes, knobs
  ```
  For `extrude` the profile is `[z, y]` on axis x, `[x, z]` on y, `[x, y]`
  on z. Every helper returns faces wound outward; `windOutward(mesh)`
  fixes a hand-made one. `examples/pistol/generate.mjs` (a flintlock from
  extruded profiles) and `examples/lantern/generate.mjs` (lathes, a box,
  rods) are the models to copy.
- **Conventions**: the same scale as the 2D art (a pistol ~24 units
  long); one part per thing that moves, its pivot at the hinge; parts
  that pass through each other project badly (the painter's order is
  per part), so split them; keep a ball's centre on or in front of the
  surface it sits on; tokens for colour, `shade` for baked light,
  `emissive` for glow.
- **Project** to 2D: `npx fart project model.fart --view left --view top
  [--outline ink:0.25]`. A turn about the view axis stays a real 2D pose
  (parents kept, clips tweened); anything else bakes into variant parts
  (`hammer@1`) and the clip subdivides at 12 fps. `left` is the
  side-scroller profile (muzzle right), `top` the top-down sprite (muzzle
  up). `spec/PROJECT.md` has the rules.
- **Export** for other engines: `npx fart gltf model.fart` writes a
  `.glb` (a node per part, vertex colours, an animation per clip, y-up).
- **Collision in 3D (1.4)**: `collision` holds `ball`, `rod`, convex
  `mesh`, and `box` (`at` centre, `size` full extents, optional `rotate`;
  never in `shapes`). A collision `mesh` must be **convex** (error
  `convex`, naming the face): author concave solids as several pieces.
  `part` makes a solid ride a part; `layer` tags it. `npx fart hull
  model.fart [--part name]` writes a convex hull of each part's visible
  shapes into `collision` (`meta.hull` marks them, rerun replaces), so
  most props need no hand-written collision. The model screen's
  Collision button shows the solids posed, and a part's **hull** button
  does the same as the CLI.
- **Look at it**: open the folder in Uranus; a 3D file opens the model
  screen (orbit, the four tools make box/ball/rod/prism, Project…).

### Loading in a 3D game (Odin, raylib)

`loaders/odin/examples/raylib_spin/main.odin` is the whole loop; the
shape of it:

```odin
doc, ok := fastart.load_bytes_3d(data)              // load_bytes refuses 3D files; this reads them
fastart.resolve_palettes_3d(&doc, resolver, nil)
for &p in doc.parts {                                // once: flatten each part to triangles
    tms := make([dynamic]fastart.Tri_Mesh)
    fastart.flatten_part(&doc, &p, &tms)             // per shape: positions, normals (rest space), color token, shade
    // upload: fastart.to_y_up(pos), to_y_up(normal); colour = shade_color(color_of_3d(&doc, tm.color), tm.shade)
}
fastart.sample_clip_3d(&doc, clip, t, &frame)       // every frame: the pose
fastart.sample_targets_3d(&doc, clip, t, &targets); fastart.solve_targets_3d(&doc, &frame, targets[:])   // live IK, if any
fastart.collision_world_3d(&doc, frame[:], &colliders)   // the solids under this pose: ball / rod / mesh (boxes arrive as meshes), each with .layer and .part
for sp in frame {
    W := fastart.Y_UP * fastart.world_xf_3d(&doc, frame[:], sp.part)   // rest → engine space
    rl.DrawMesh(mesh, material, rl.Matrix(W))
}
```

Light in a shader from the normals, or bake it into vertex colours the
way the example does. `blend_poses_3d`, `layer_poses_3d`,
`clip_events_3d`, `attach_xf_3d` (dir-aligned sockets) and
`apply_palette_3d` are the 2D calls with a third axis.

**TypeScript**: `as3d`, `worldTransforms3`, `sampleClip3`, `sampleTargets3`,
`solveTargets3`, `flattenPart`/`triMesh`, `Y_UP`, `projectDoc`, `toGlb`.

## Textures

No bitmaps: a texture is a set of **maps** and every map is a 2D `.fart`
tiled over a `cell`, in 2D and 3D alike.

```json
"textures": [{"name": "planks", "cell": [8, 8], "maps": {
  "color":  {"ref": "textures/planks.fart"},
  "height": {"ref": "textures/planks.fart", "palette": "palettes/height.fart", "mode": "mask"},
  "glow":   {"ref": "textures/planks.fart", "state": "knots"}}}]
```

- `color` is what readers paint: `paint` (default) lays its colours over
  the shape's slot where it paints, the slot shows through elsewhere;
  `mask` multiplies the slot by the map's luminance. Every other map is
  a scalar the engine reads (luminance × alpha × shade), named whatever
  the game says (`height`, `glow`, `rough`). The same drawing under
  another `palette` or `state` is another map, so maps line up for free.
- A shape takes `"texture": "planks"` and a `mapping`: in 2D
  `{"at": [x, y], "angle": a, "scale": s}` placing pattern space in the
  shape's space (or `xf`, six numbers, as a projection writes); in 3D
  `{"scale": s}` for **box mapping** (each face reads the two world axes
  across its normal, so planks line up across a wall with nothing
  authored) or `{"uvs": [[[u, v], ...] per face]}` per corner. Balls and
  rods box-map as the meshes they flatten to. A palette swap still
  recolours the slot underneath.
- Draw the map in the 2D editor (its cell is `[0, 0]` to `[w, h]` of the
  drawing's space; shapes crossing the edge wrap). `npx fart bake
  --textures out/ --px 64 model.fart` writes each map as a PNG for a
  build; `fart gltf` embeds the colour map; the projector carries a
  face's mapping into the 2D file as an `xf`. Loaders give pattern
  coordinates per vertex (`triMesh(...).uvs`, `Tri_Mesh.uvs`; divide by
  the cell for 0..1) and `resolve_textures_3d` reads the maps' drawings;
  the raylib example rasterises one with `draw_2d`. Sample textures:
  `examples/cabin/textures`, `examples/space/textures`.

## Scenes: .shart

A `.shart` (Scene Hierarchy of Art, dot-s-h-art) composes farts into a
scene and draws nothing of its own. `spec/SHART.md` is the contract.

```json
{"version": 1, "space": "3d", "name": "camp", "palette_refs": ["palettes/night.fart"],
 "nodes": [
   {"name": "hut", "ref": "cabin.fart", "at": [0, 0, 0], "state": "closed",
    "children": [{"name": "lamp", "ref": "lantern.fart", "attach": {"to": "hook", "by": "grip"}}]},
   {"name": "guard", "ref": "hero.fart", "at": [14, 0, 6], "rotate": [0, 1.2, 0], "clip": "idle", "t": 0.4, "palette": "palettes/red.fart"},
   {"name": "rocks", "at": [-20, 0, 0], "children": [{"name": "a", "ref": "rock.fart"}, {"name": "b", "ref": "rock.fart", "at": [4, 0, 2], "scale": 0.6, "mirror": true}]},
   {"name": "annex", "ref": "yard.shart", "at": [30, 0, 0]}]}
```

- A node is an instance (`ref` a `.fart`), a placed scene (`ref` a
  `.shart`), or a group (no `ref`). `at`, `rotate` (a number in 2D,
  `[x, y, z]` in 3D), `scale`, `mirror` pose it in its parent's frame.
  `state` or `clip` + `t` picks what it shows; `palette` recolours it;
  the scene's `palette_refs` recolour everything. `attach` hangs a child
  from a socket of its parent's art, positions and directions matched
  (`to` on the parent, `by` on the child; `by` absent = the child's
  origin). Names are unique among siblings; refs are relative; every
  ref is of the scene's space.
- Paint order in 2D: list order, children after their parent. 3D is by
  depth.
- Check: `npx fart validate camp.shart` (reads the files it names:
  `ref.state`, `ref.clip`, `ref.anchor`, `space`, `cycle`). See it:
  `npx fart flatten camp.shart` lists every instance placed; Uranus
  opens a scene on its shelf.
- Load: TypeScript `parseScene` → `loadScene(scene, read)` →
  `flattenScene(loaded, {time})` → for each `Placed`: draw its `doc`
  with its `poses` and `tokens`, the instance `xf` in front of the
  part's world map; `sceneCollision(placed)` for the solids. Odin:
  `load_scene` → `flatten_scene(&scene, resolver, user, &cache, &placed,
  time)` → each `Placed` has `doc`/`doc3`, `poses`/`poses3`, `tokens`
  (use `token_color`), `xf`/`xf3`. Keep the `Scene_Cache` for the
  scene's life; `destroy_placed` each frame if you re-flatten.

## Workflow

1. Write the JSON (by hand for one file; by a small script for a set,
   starting from `{{FASTART}}/examples/space/generate.mjs`, which has the
   helpers: mirrored parts, baked tris, validation, writing). For 3D,
   start from `{{FASTART}}/examples/lantern/generate.mjs` and core's
   `box`, `extrude`, `lathe`.
2. Validate, always:
   `cd {{FASTART}} && make validate DIR=/path/to/art` (every `.fart`
   below, refs resolved). Fix every error; warnings about unknown fields
   are yours to judge.
3. Look at it: `cd {{FASTART}} && make serve DIR=/path/to/art` and open
   `http://localhost:4747` (headless Playwright works against it too), or
   open the folder in Uranus (the fastart studio app). Pick a clip and scrub. A tour
   script can read `globalThis.fastart` (the store, `frameW()` world
   transforms) to assert poses.
4. Use it in the game (below). Ignore `*.fart~` files: they are the
   studio's checkpoints (gitignore them).

## Loading in a game

**Odin** (the reference loader, `{{FASTART}}/loaders/odin`, copied into a
game as package `fastart`):

```odin
doc, ok := fastart.load_bytes(data)            // or load_file(path)
fastart.resolve_palettes(&doc, resolver, nil)   // resolver: proc(path: string, user: rawptr) -> ([]byte, bool), path is the ref as written
rgb := fastart.color_of(&doc, "hull")           // [4]u8
st  := fastart.state_of(&doc, "idle")           // ^State, its .parts is the pose list
for sp in st.parts {                            // paint order
    part := fastart.part_of(&doc, sp.part)
    W := fastart.world_xf(&doc, st.parts[:], part.name)   // parents applied
    // draw part.shapes through W (poly: tris are index triples into points), then the entity's own placement
}
frame := make([dynamic]fastart.State_Part, context.temp_allocator)
fastart.sample_clip(&doc, fastart.clip_of(&doc, "thrust"), t, &frame)   // a pose list at time t
d := fastart.clip_duration(c)
red, _ := fastart.load_bytes(red_palette_bytes)
fastart.apply_palette(&doc, red.palette[:])     // a swap: same slot names, new colours
```

Anchors: `xf_apply(world_xf(...), anchor.at)` gives the point in the
posed drawing; use `anchors_of` / `anchor_of` so `like` parts resolve.
`destroy(&doc)` frees the containers; games that load into an arena
drop the lot.

Runtime operations (1.2), no file changes needed:

```odin
fastart.blend_poses(&doc, a[:], b[:], w, &out)   // two clips at once: crossfades
fastart.layer_poses(&doc, gait[:], head[:], w, &out)  // a layer over a base: head turn over a walk
fastart.clip_events(c, t_prev, t_now, &names)     // what fired since last frame (loop-aware)
fastart.sample_targets(&doc, c, t, &targets); fastart.solve_targets(&doc, &poses, targets[:])  // live IK
fastart.solve_chain(&doc, &poses, constraint, point)  // reach a point now (feet on a slope)
```
Draw with `shapes_of(&doc, part)`, never `part.shapes`, so parts drawn
like another show up.

**TypeScript** (`@fastart/core`, zero deps; not on npm yet, import from
`{{FASTART}}/packages/core/dist/index.js`): `parseDoc`, `validate`,
`resolvePalettes`, `colorOf`, `applyPalette`, `worldTransforms`,
`drawList`, `sampleClip`, `sampleTargets`, `solveTargets`, `clipEvents`,
`blendPoses`, `layerPoses`, `attachXf`, `shapesOf`, `anchorsOf`,
`clipDuration`, `solveChain`, `bakeTris`, `stringifyDoc`.

## Inside Uranus

When the `uranus` tools are present (mcp__uranus__*), you are in the
studio's Ask panel and the user is looking at the canvas. Work through
the editor, not the file system:

1. `get_document`: the open file, what is selected, which state or clip
   is on the canvas, the shared slot names, the project's files.
2. Change the document in memory, then `apply_document` with the whole
   document and a one-line `note`; it is validated and applied as one
   undo step. A refusal returns the errors: fix and apply again.
3. `render` a state or a clip frame to see what you did; `validate` a
   document you are unsure of before applying.
4. `open_file` to move to another file of the project.

Reply in a sentence or two: what changed. The user sees each tool use
and the note.

## Mistakes that bite

- `offset` is where the pivot *lands*, not a nudge. To draw as authored,
  leave it out (or set it to the pivot).
- A child's pivot should sit at the joint, on the parent, so turning it
  reads as articulation.
- A state that leaves a part out hides it; a clip key with `parts`
  must list every part that should show at that moment.
- `palette_refs` paths are relative to the file that names them
  (`../palettes/hull.fart` from `ships/`).
- A dark shape on a dark panel disappears: check the thumbnail.
- The version is the major: `"version": 1` (a number). Minor features
  (`parent`, `clips`, `constraints`, the 1.2 fields) need no version bump.
- A part with `like` must not carry `shapes` or `anchors`; the validator
  refuses it (`like`). A target must name a real chain (`ref.chain`).
- Blending and layering are runtime calls on sampled poses, not fields;
  a "flinch on top of a walk" is `layer_poses` with a weight that rises
  and falls.
- A 3D file is refused by 2D loaders (`load_bytes` says no;
  `load_bytes_3d` reads it). Inside Uranus with a model open,
  `get_document` says so and `render` takes a `view` (front, left, top,
  … or [x, y, z] radians).
- Mesh faces wind outward. Use the helpers, or `windOutward`; a face
  wound the wrong way vanishes in every view and every projection.
- `extrude`'s profile is in the plane's other two axes in a fixed order
  (`[z, y]` for x); a profile typed as `[y, z]` comes out mirrored.
- A sampled target only exists once the playhead reaches the key that
  names it; give the outgoing key a target too if the hand must track
  from the start.
